## üèóÔ∏è Step 1: Provision Infrastructure

Run the following PowerShell script to set up the infrastructure:

```powershell
# Provision the infrastructure
.\scripts\create_infrastructure.ps1

- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`

The `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret should have this JSON format:

```json

  "clientSecret": "<client_secret>",
  "subscriptionId": "<subscription_id>",
  "tenantId": "<tenant_id>"
}
```

## üöÄ Step 3: Deploy Application to AKS

Trigger the CI/CD workflow to perform the following:

- Build the application
- Create a Docker image
- Push the image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Deploy the image to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

---

## ‚úÖ Done

Once the workflow completes, your application should be live on AKS.
